### 1. Create a Branch
Create a new branch in the repository from the main branch.


# Clone the repository if you haven't already
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

# Pull the latest changes from the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>


### 2. Modify the Environment
Make the necessary changes in your environment (add, modify, or delete files as needed). 

- If you delete files in your local environment, Git will track these deletions.
- If you add or modify files, those changes will also be tracked.



### 3. Stage and Commit the Changes
After making changes, stage and commit them.


# Check the status of changes
git status

# Stage the changes (including deletions)
git add -A

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Describe your changes, including deletions"



### 4. Push the Branch
Push your new branch to the remote repository.

git push origin <new_branch_name>



### 5. Create a Pull Request
Go to the repository's hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and create a pull request to merge `<new_branch_name>` into `main`.


### 6. Merge and Reflect Changes
Once the pull request is approved and merged:
- Your changes (including deletions) will reflect in the `main` branch.
- Other collaborators will see the updated content when they pull from `main`.
